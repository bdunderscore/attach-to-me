# Attach-To-Me for VRChat manual

## About this prefab

This prefab implements a versatile system for attaching props to avatars in VRChat. Players can attach props to either themselves or others. This allows for, for example, helping place accessories on a friend in places where it would be awkward or hard to see to do so yourself.

Position tracking is done locally, ensuring that there is no lag when tracking the underlying bones.
